              Why this framework matters for your organization:
            </h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-primary-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Most leaders assume their communication primarily operates in the "Open Area," but distributed workforces often have extensive "Blind Spot" and "Hidden Area" activity that creates disconnection and missed opportunities.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-primary-800 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Our job is to map these areas using both surveys and investigation,then help you expand that "Open Area" so information flows both ways,effectively,through both formal and informal channels. Understanding your informal communication networks isn't about controlling themâ€”it's about designing formal systems that work with them productively rather than fighting against them.
